# Generative AI Lab – CMU Spring 2025

This repository contains my hands-on projects, experiments, and learning notes from the *Generative AI Lab (94-844)* course at Carnegie Mellon University, taught by Prof. Beibei Li.

The course explores the theory and application of cutting-edge generative models including:
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Transformers & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Diffusion Models for image generation
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- AI Agents & Workflow automation
- Red Teaming and Safety strategies in GenAI

💡 Each folder or script in this repo highlights a core concept or model, with step-by-step code, real API calls (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.), and personal notes.  
This repo will grow as the course progresses — starting with basic prompt engineering using OpenAI’s API.
